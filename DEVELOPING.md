# Developer Guide
Pyrex development information and processes

## Linting
Pyrex conforms to [PEP8](https://pep8.org/) for all Python code, and also make
use of [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) as a linter. Please ensure
all code conforms to this. There is helpful tool that will report any places
where the code is non-conformant in the project root:

```shell
./lint
```

If you would like to tool to automatically reformat code to comply with PEP8,
pass the `--reformat` option:

```
./lint --reformat
```

## Testing
Pyrex has a comprehensive test suite that can be used to test all generated
Docker images. Some external test data is required to perform the test. To
download this data and prepare your sandbox for testing, run:

```shell
./ci/prepare.sh
```

Once this is complete, the automated testing suite can be invoked with the
command:

```shell
./ci/test.py -vb
```

The test suite uses Python unittest, so additional [command line options][] are
available.

The test suite will build all Pyrex image locally and run a set of tests
against them. If you would like to limit which images are tested, additional
arguments can be passed to filter the tests. Each image is tested using a test
class named `PyrexImage_IMAGE` where `IMAGE` is the test image name will all
non-word characters replaced by `_`.  For example, to test only the
`ubuntu-18.04-oe` image, run:

```shell
./ci/test.py -vb PyrexImage_ubuntu_18_04_oe
```

## Building images locally
Pyrex pulls prebuilt Docker containers from DockerHub by default, which should
be sufficient for most users. However, users that are active developing on
Pyrex or wish to build images locally instead of using published images can do
so by making the following changes to `pyrex.ini`:

1. Set `config:buildlocal` to `1`
2. Change `config:tag` to an alternate tag suffix instead of
   `:${config:pyrextag}`. While not strictly necessary, this step will help
   prevent confusion if you want to switch back to prebuilt images. If you
   choose not to change this, realize that your locally built images will
   overwrite your local docker cache tags for the prebuilt images. As an
   example, you might add the following to `pyrex.ini`:

    ```
    [config]
    tag = ${config:dockerimage}:my-image
    ```

3. Set `config:dockerfile` to the path where the Dockerfile you wish to build
   is located. Alternatively, you can leave it as the default to build the
   standard Pyrex images locally.

## Making a release
To make a release of Pyrex:

1. Bump the `VERSION` in [pyrex.py](./pyrex.py). Note that all versions should
   be of the form `MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO` + an optional `-*` suffix. For example,
   the following are all valid versions: `1.0.0`, `1.0.0-rc1`. Stable releases
   intended for general consumption should always be in the form
   `MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO` without any suffix. Push this change to the master
   branch.
2. Wait for [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/garmin/pyrex/branches) to finish the
   CI build and verify it passes
3. Create a new [GitHub Release](https://github.com/garmin/pyrex/releases). The
   release must be tagged with the version in `pyrex.py`, prefixed with `v`.
   For example, the `1.0.0` release would be tagged `v1.0.0`
4. Tagging the repository will trigger a new Travis CI build. This build will
   automatically push the docker images to
   [dockerhub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/garminpyrex/repository/list) using
   the same tag that was created for the release. Verify that the CI build
   passes and the docker images are pushed. In the unlikely event this fails,
   delete the release, fix the issue, and try again.

## When to release
At a minimum, releases should be made whenever changes are made to one of the
Dockerfile image files. This ensure that users who are tracking the master
branch of Pyrex (as opposed to sticking to a released tag) get the new docker
images.
